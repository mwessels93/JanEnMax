# JanEnMax

This script aims to use the clustering method K-mediods with the Manhattan metric to cluster data from the Gigyanalysis dataset. It utilizes multiple visualizations to arrive at a conclusion about the performance of the clustering method.

The script uses Numpy, Os, Matplotlib and kmediods libraries. The first four can be installed using the 'pip install' command and the kmediods script is from: # Bauckhage C. Numpy/scipy Recipes for Data Science: k-Medoids Clustering[R]. Technical Report, University of Bonn, 2015.
